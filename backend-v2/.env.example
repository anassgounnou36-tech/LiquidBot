# Execution control
# CRITICAL: Controls whether real liquidation transactions are sent on-chain
# - Set to "true" to enable real liquidation execution (DANGEROUS - use with care!)
# - Set to "false" for dry-run mode (logs only, no transactions sent)
# 
# Safety features when EXECUTION_ENABLED=true:
# - expectedCollateralOut must be > 0
# - minOut must be > debtToCover
# - Slippage within configured max (5%)
# - All safety checks must pass before tx is sent

# Chainlink feeds (JSON format: {"SYMBOL": "0xFeedAddress", ...})
# Example: {"WETH":"0x71041dddad3595F9CEd3DcCFBe3D1F4b0a16Bb70","USDC":"0x..."}
# 
# IMPORTANT: ETH aliasing on Base network
# - On Base, ETH prices are often provided via WETH feeds
# - If you have a WETH feed but no ETH feed, priceMath will automatically alias ETH→WETH
# - This is safe because WETH is 1:1 with ETH
# 
# REQUIRED ratio feeds for liquid staking tokens (LSTs):
# These tokens require *_ETH ratio feeds, not direct USD feeds:
# - WSTETH_ETH: for wstETH USD pricing via WSTETH_ETH × ETH_USD composition
# - WEETH_ETH: for weETH USD pricing via WEETH_ETH × ETH_USD composition
# - CBETH_ETH: for cbETH USD pricing via CBETH_ETH × ETH_USD composition
# 
# The bot will automatically compose these ratio feeds with ETH_USD to get USD prices.

# 
# This enables address-first pricing WITHOUT symbol() calls in the execution path.
# When this is configured, getUsdPriceForAddress() will use this mapping directly
# instead of resolving address→symbol→feed.
# 
# This is OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED for production as it avoids runtime symbol() queries.
